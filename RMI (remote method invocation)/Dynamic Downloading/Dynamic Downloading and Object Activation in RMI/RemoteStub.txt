RemoteStub is the superclass for all remote stub classes.

these are the classes, they act as proxy, for remote call 
from one JVM to another.

when you run rmic,   the stub file that is produced is a 
subclass of RemoteStub.

It implements same remote interface as the original remote class,
but proxies all of the remote methods into remote method call 
on the actual remote object implementation
(by connecting to and communicating with the skeleton).


when you look up a remote reference in a naming registry,
you actually receive an instance of this stub class.


by itself, the RemoteStub class provides no methods of particular use.
